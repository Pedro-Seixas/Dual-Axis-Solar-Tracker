# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker
An Embedded Systems project done with A. Casey.

### The Idea
A solar tracker is a system that tracks an incoming light source and moves the solar panel to that direction to always receive the maximum amount of light possible.

### Equipment
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* 3D Printed models
* Perf board
* 4 200-ohms resistors
* 4 Photoresistors
* 2 Servo motors
* Solar panel
* MicroChip Software (AVR C)
